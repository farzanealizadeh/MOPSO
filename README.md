# MOPSO
Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization is used in this code. which has 3 objectives. The restrictions related to this optimization are given in the function "simulation (iteration, particle_index)". In this optimization, the subject are given as a penalty in the objective function.
This project included simulation optimization. At this point, just the optimization section is provided, and a function named "simulation (iteration, particle_index)" is constructed, but it is excluded for clarity in understanding the simulation.
